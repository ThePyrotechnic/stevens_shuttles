##Issues with Stevens' paper schedules
1. The gray line night schedule appears to be missing two stops:
    - `ScheduleManager.UnknownStop: Stop 4220780 not found in route 4011460`
    - `ScheduleManager.UnknownStop: Stop 4211464 not found in route 4011460`
2. The gray line late schedule appears to be visiting 8th & monroe (`4220778`) and 8th & jackson st (`4220774`) instead of 8th & madison (`4111538`)
