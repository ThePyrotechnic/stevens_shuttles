## Known issues with Stevens' paper schedules
1. The gray line night schedule appears to be missing two stops:
    - `ScheduleManager.UnknownStop: Stop 4220780 not found in route 4011460` (12th & clinton)
    - `ScheduleManager.UnknownStop: Stop 4211464 not found in route 4011460` (12th & park)
2. The gray line late schedule appears to be visiting 8th & jackson (`4220774`) instead of 8th & madison (`4111538`)
3. The blue line has covered for the green line at least once (on 10/15/18). 
This is a problem since people who have the blue line filtered out will not see the shuttle coming on the TransLoc app
